# The go-templ-tailwind-htmx-project-template (GoTTH) starter

Allows you quickly setup all the required (boilerplate) files, folders and packages for starting your GoTTH stack project. 

The GoTTH stack is basically an awesome web-stack without (much) javascript:

- Go - Backend
- Tailwind - CSS
- Templ - Templating
- HTMX - Interactivity


> [!NOTE]  
>Out of the box this repository contains also [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
>All the CSS, and javascripts files are hosted locally, so it does not require an external connection.
